## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a third year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I found my interest in engineering through my passion for creation: I enjoy designing from idea to reality, making things come to life with motion. Each step becomes a puzzle for me to fit the best solution to a problem. I have a strong focus in robotics and human-machine interactions.
