Prototype of pedal mechanism driven by bowden cables.
A double pulley system allows the movement of the cables to be mapped to the downward motion of the foot.
Connecting to modular prosthetics, this allows an extra degree of freedom for amputees, controlled by foot to enhance dexterous manipulation of various tools.
Shown in the photo is a tool that is designed for playing the violin, attempting to imitate the natural motion of the wrist while holding the bow. The mechanism allows for around 90 degrees of rotation in the wrist joint.
