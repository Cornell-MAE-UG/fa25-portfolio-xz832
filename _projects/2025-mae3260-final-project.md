Our goal for this project is to design a non-ratcheting, 3/8 inch drive instrumented torque wrench rated for 600 in-lbf. Torque will be transduced using strain gauges bonded to the outer surfaces of the wrench at high strain locations. The design of the torque wrench will have to satisfy the following requirements:
1. attain at least 1.0 mV/V output at the rated torque of 600 in-lbf
2. safety factor of Xo = 4 for yield failure as it is a ductile material
3. safety factor of Xk = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth 0.04 inches (1 mm)
4. fatigue stress safety factor of Xs = 1.5
5. material must be a steel, aluminum or titanium alloy.
