For our Introduction to Mechanical Design class, we were asked to CAD a complex object. I chose to model my box cutter, containing all the inner mechanisms such as the spring-loaded auto-lock and the blade snapper.

I first took the box cutter apart to measure each component and analyze how they all fit together to from the moving mechanism.

The sloping geometry towards the cutting end of the cutter thins out the body of the blade housing to guide the blade as it is engaged. It keeps the blade steady and limits any unwanted movement during usage. The 'spring' in the auto-lock was a piece of thin, bent metal that locked into the ridges of the box cutter as the slider moves along to prevent accidental retraction.

I then made components of each element in Fusion, assembling them together with joints to mimic the real life motion of the box cutter.
